        <p>When I started writing articles for this blog, I only needed to open a text
editor, write something interesting and publish it. This in itself was already
hard enough. Expressing your own thoughts and feelings to the world is

<p>My hacker nature wanted to push harder and farther. I&rsquo;ve introduced the need to
publish every article with a hand drawn image. Following this, I&rsquo;ve introduced
several review cycles in a hope that I will reduce the number of grammar errors.
Then, I&rsquo;ve added additional background images to the site which required color
matching between them and the header image on the articles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/old_design.jpg" alt="Old shiroyasha.io design" /></p>

<p>I enjoyed tweaking the colors on the page, drawing images, and fixing issues
with the responsive css layout, but unfortunately all of this took quite a bit
of time. I need at least two hours to write an article, and at least three hours
to draw a decent image for it. Usually it took me around six hours to produce
one article. Six hours is unfortunately too much for someone who has a full time
job, exercises regularly, and gives his best to be in touch with his friends and
family. I&rsquo;ve had to reduce the unnecessary overhead, or to give up writing
articles for this site altogether.</p>

<p>So I did the first thing and removed everything that was time consuming. No more
images, no more unnecessary reviews, and no more responsive things on the page.
Now I can once again open my good old Vim, write an article, and publish it the
same day!</p>

<p>I hope that this will increase the number of things I can share, and achieve the
magical number of one article per week.</p>

<p>Cheers for keeping things simple and easy!</p>
