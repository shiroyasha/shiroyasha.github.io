      <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1019452/">A Serious Man</a> is probably one of my all
time favorite movies. The protagonist, a simple physics professor, with a
simple, happy life, is suddenly hit by a streak of miss fortunate events. His
wife leaves him, while he is forced out of his own house. He is blackmailed
at work.</p>

<p>He is a good man, and he considers himself a serious, but kind person. Every
issue he faces is not a life-or-death situation, but rather, a calm storm that
eats away his soul. The kind of issue, when you can&rsquo;t just pick up a weapon and
fight your issues like in an action movie.</p>

<p>While he watches his life unravel over multiple sudden incidents, he tries to
seek meaning and answers amidst his turmoils. He keeps repeating that he didn&rsquo;t
do anything to deserve this, failing to realize that in fact his inaction is
the reason for his fall.</p>

<h2>Sometimes life wants to slap you in the face</h2>

<p>This year, in a sense, presented a similar challenge for me too. Nothing that
happened, wasn&rsquo;t a major issue, but my general life happiness decreased
significantly.</p>

<p>I started this year by splitting up with my long time girlfriend, which left me
in a state of general numbness. In a state when the only thing you want to
do is to scream at life and solve your issue by punching walls as hard as you
can. I even hooked up with another girl, just to numb the pain, a decision
which probably made the situation even worse.</p>

<p>This was followed by the fact that the person who made me join my current
workplace, a man I respected immensely, left the company.</p>

<p>Financially, I was still struggling to pay back my student loans, which were
keeping me in a constant state of anxiety.</p>

<p>The worst thing was probably the fact that I was still overweight, unfit, with
bad eating habits.</p>

<h2>Being a professional</h2>

<p>As a kind of a grown up person, you can&rsquo;t let your emotions hit the surface.
Even if the only thing you want is to intoxicate yourself, cry, and generally be
angry, you have a responsibility to keep a straight face for your friends and
colleagues.</p>

<p>Every person has some kind of a struggle, you won&rsquo;t help them if you just hit
them with your own issue. On the other side, however, it is harder to heal your
own wounds if you don&rsquo;t let the world know that.</p>

<h2>Dipping your feet in the ocean</h2>

<p>My anxiety was worsening every day. It was too hard for me to just relax and
enjoy life, even if I deep down knew that &lsquo;letting go&rsquo; is probably the only real
cure.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, I was invited to give a speech in Porto, Portugal. I wasn&rsquo;t
expecting anything big from the trip. Even the weather was against me, as it was
raining every day while I was there.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to let the bad whether stop me from taking a walk through the
city. I bought a cheap umbrella, and I started walking toward the ocean. This
would be the first time for me to see the Atlantic ocean. I was a bit thrilled
by this fact.</p>

<p>I was 2 hours away from the beach. The only thing I was wearing was a
thin shirt, and a flip-flop on my feat. Needless to say, I was totally wet when
I arrived. But it was all worth it. The endless water, was breathtaking. The
wind was creating these giant waves that were hitting a stone on the beach with
immense force.</p>

<p>I felt small. It was a good feeling. The vastness of the ocean made me lose
focus, and I was just glaring at the endless nothing.</p>

<p>I decided to take down my flip-flops, roll up my trousers and jump in the water.
Fu$!##!$$kkk. It was cold as hell.</p>

<h2>Happiness</h2>

<p>For some weird reason, that moment changed everything. It felt like a giant rock
fell of my back, and I was free to enjoy life, again. This was around two months
from today, but I am still happy, calm, and wear a genuine smile every day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/zen/happiness.jpg" alt="Happiness" /></p>

<p>It is still super weird how easy was for me to get depressed, angry, anxious
and pissed of at life. It is even weirded that I only needed to jump into cold
water at the other side of Europe for it to all go away.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the only real advice I can give my future self, comes
from Rocky:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep
moving forward. That’s how winning is done!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<p>This was a bit different post from the others. I hope you enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Stay awesome!</p>
