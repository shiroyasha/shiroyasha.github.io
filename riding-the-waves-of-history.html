        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to predict the future,&rdquo; I texted my friend last week. 
We&rsquo;d been messaging back and forth about AI, sharing links about 
ChatGPT&rsquo;s latest image generation capabilities, and debating 
whether programming as we know it is dead. The conversation had 
that familiar mix of excitement, dread, and philosophical hot-takes
that seems to follow most discussions of artificial intelligence 
these days.</p>

<p>After sharing some thoughts about how mid-level jobs might be 
affected, I found myself typing: &ldquo;We ride on the waves of history&rdquo;.
It wasn&rsquo;t resignation of the future, but a recognition that some 
forces are bigger than our ability to control them.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with for months is this: In a world where 
technological change is happening at a pace that makes any five-year
plans seem like a pile of crap, my instinct is to crave certainty.
To look for predictions. </p>

<p>My friend and I had just spent a couple of hours sharing tweets about 
AI-generated ghibli images and debating whether developers and designers
are screwed. We swapped articles with doomsday predictions, then links 
to optimistic counterpoints, searching for some answer that 
would make sense of it all.</p>

<p>But what if that&rsquo;s the wrong approach entirely?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe that our relationship with uncertainty itself may 
be the most important skill to develop in this moment of history. Not 
predictions about AGI timelines or which jobs will be automated or 
if we&rsquo;re months away from digital overlords, but rather, how we position
ourselves mentally when the only certainty is rapid change.</p>

<p>Learning how to surf instead of building ever-higher damns to protect us
from the incoming cunami. How we relate to uncertainty determines everything
downstream: what we build, how we invest our time, what skills we develop, 
and perhaps most importantly, whether we face the future with creative 
optimism or defensive pessimism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Optimists push the world forward,&rdquo; I wrote to him toward the end of our 
conversation. </p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about riding waves instead of being crushed by them. About 
what it means to live in <em>interesting times</em> when the only certainty 
is change itself.</p>

<h2>Riding the waves</h2>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t about blind optimism, it is about recognizing that adaptability 
beats prediction every time. The most valuable skill isn&rsquo;t foreseeing which
technologies will dominate, but developing frameworks that lets the world
change, without you drowning in it.</p>

<p>Taleb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antifragile&rdquo; celebrates systems that gain from disorder. Mark&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;In Search of Certainty&rdquo; exposes our addiction to false certainties, and 
people who are more than happy to sell them to us. Neither of the books offers
a prophecy.</p>

<p>History doesn&rsquo;t move in straight lines. Neither should our thinking. The
surfer doesn&rsquo;t control the ocean. Ha masters responding to it. Fewer damns 
and more surfboards. The waves are coming. The only question is whether 
we&rsquo;ll learn to ride them.</p>
