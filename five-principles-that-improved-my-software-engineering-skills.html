    <p>Mentoring younger developers is a very rewarding experience. It challenges your
your pre-established ways of thinking, and it forces you to re-evaluate your
long held principles. For example, a simple question like &ldquo;Why does it matter
to DRY out your code?&rdquo; is remarkably hard to answer.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, I was asked to provide tips and guidance on how to
become a better software engineer. Sadly, I rarely gave a satisfying answer. It
is hard to come up with a good advice on the spot.</p>

<p>This article is an attempt to systematically prepare and share a set of
principles that helped me to become a better engineer. Obviously, there are as
many learning styles as there are people, but these are what work for me.</p>

<p>I identified five principles that are the fundamentals of my learning style.</p>

<h3>1. Start with a real problem, not with solutions</h3>

<p>I am sure that there are people out there who can simply learn just for the sake
of intellectual curiosity. But that is not how it works for me. I need to have
a real reason for learning something.</p>

<p>For example, learning the actor model because my friend told me it&rsquo;s an
interesting approach for structuring programs won&rsquo;t really keep my attention too
long. I might learn the basics, but I will soon hop on to the next thing that
grabs my curiosity.</p>

<p>Instead of learning a technology, an establish pattern or way of thinking, I
find it much easier to learn as I was on a mission to fix something. For
example, if I notice that I create lots of concurrency related bugs in my code,
I go on a mission to figure out a way to improve this process and I explore the
actor model as one of the possible solutions.</p>

<p>Starting with a problem that directly affects a human helps me in three ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a strong motivation for learning, which keeps my focus in place.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&rsquo;t keep learning every small, potentially insignificant detail. For
example, the mathematical model behind the actor model is perhaps interesting,
but ultimately it doesn&rsquo;t bring me closer to anything in real in my life.</p></li>
<li><p>When I find a solution, a real human being&rsquo;s life gets better. This boosts my
happiness levels, and inspires me to push on, even if it gets too hard.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Focus on the 80 percent, explore the 20 percent</h3>

<p>Perfection is useless. I try to focus on the core 80 percent of the problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When learning, I learn the core of the idea. I&rsquo;ll learn the rest when I
really need it.</p></li>
<li><p>I strive to be an engineer that is not a just a &ldquo;bug fixer&rdquo;. Fixing bugs is
an important skill to have, but first, I want to be a confident creator who
can create things from scratch.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>3. There are no problems out of my league</h3>

<p>I observed two detrimental patterns in my life:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an not smart enough to know that many things&rdquo; pattern, where I
would freeze when the problem was outside of my domain.</p></li>
<li><p>The &ldquo;I&rsquo;m am too good to learn about those insignificant details&rdquo; pattern,
where a I would refuse to tackle some issues because I thought that I am too
good for them. For example, fixing a CSS bug is not worthy of my time, even if
all of our customers are suffering to use our product.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both issues are related to my inertia as a software engineer. I like to ask
myself the question &ldquo;Is this really that hard (easy) that I can&rsquo;t push through
it with just a bit of extra effort?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I are not less or more capable than anyone else. We are all humans.</p>

<p>There are no hard programming languages, each of them can be learned in a matter
of weeks. Human interaction issues are also just a type of issue. Everything
can be learned quite easily. Whining about an issue won&rsquo;t really help anyone.</p>

<p>Many times, even 20 percent of the full knowledge from some other area can
allow me to do things 10x faster, just because I don&rsquo;t need to hand over the
problem.</p>

<h3>4. Always keep improving your basics</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a sad thing when a software engineer doesn&rsquo;t know how to use <code>grep</code> to find
a pattern recursively in a directory. Or when you don&rsquo;t know how to follow TDD
principles. Or when you struggle with the shortcuts in your editor of choice.</p>

<p>The basics are basics for a reason. Once I learned them, they improved every
single day of my life.</p>

<p>I dedicate at least a portion of my time every week to keep the basics in good
condition. If I have struggled with <code>awk</code> last week, for example, I make sure to
read up a bit of from the manual page by the end of the week.</p>

<h3>5. Read a shit-ton of code</h3>

<p>Finally, the thing that improved my skills the most was reading other people&rsquo;s
work. Reading the source code Kubernetes taught me how to write proper Go code.
Reading Rails&rsquo; source code, thought me Ruby. Reading my colleagues work got me
up to speed in any area of our product.</p>

<p>The most beautiful thing about open source isn&rsquo;t that it is free. It isn&rsquo;t even
the community. It&rsquo;s the ability the download the source code, take a deep dive,
and simply enjoy a relaxing Sunday evening.</p>
