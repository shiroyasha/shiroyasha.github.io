        <p>We&rsquo;ve recently witnessed a perfect example of this parasitic behavior. A
startup, freshly minted by a once-respected incubator, had the audacity to fork
an open-source project and claim it as their own. They didn&rsquo;t innovate. They
didn&rsquo;t improve. They simply took.</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I&rsquo;m not talking about healthy competition or even inspiration
drawn from existing ideas. I&rsquo;m talking about those who shamelessly and completely
take the hard work of others, wrapping it in a shiny new package and calling it
their own.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened: This startup PairAI basically took an open-source project 
called Continue, forked it, and are now passing it off as their own groundbreaking
innovation.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the kick-you-in-the-balls: YC&rsquo;s CEO, Garry Tan, defended this copycat
behavior on Twitter. Talk about missing the forest for the trees. Sure, it might
be legal, but that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is that YC is funding startups 
with zero innovation and apparently zero due diligence.</p>

<p>Being inspired by other projects is one thing. Heck, it&rsquo;s how most of us get
started. I&rsquo;m even fine with copying. But taking someone else&rsquo;s work, changing a 
few lines of code, and calling it your own, and then apply to YC and get funded? 
That&rsquo;s a whole different story.</p>

<p>Now, some might argue that open-source licenses permit such actions. But let me
ask you this: Since when did we start confusing what&rsquo;s legally permissible with
what&rsquo;s ethically right? Since when did &ldquo;not illegal&rdquo; become the bar we&rsquo;re aiming 
for in the tech industry?</p>

<p>What message does this send to open-source projects? To the builder and the
maintainers who pour their hearts and souls into open-source projects? It tells
them that their work is up for grabs, ready to be exploited by the first
opportunist who comes along.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: Open-source isn&rsquo;t just about the license. It&rsquo;s about the
community. It&rsquo;s about giving back, not just taking. When we use open-source
tools at Operately (and we use them a lot), we always look for ways to contribute
back. Sometimes it&rsquo;s code, sometimes it&rsquo;s documentation, sometimes it&rsquo;s just
reporting bugs. But we contribute. Because that&rsquo;s how healthy ecosystems work.</p>

<p>So what can we do about it?</p>

<p>First, if you&rsquo;re an open-source maintainer or contributor, don&rsquo;t let this
discourage you. Keep building, keep sharing. The actions of a few bad actors
don&rsquo;t negate the immense value and importance of what you do. Open-source is
still one of the most powerfull fonces for good, not only in tech, but for the
whole world and society.</p>

<p>Second, to the folks at YC: It&rsquo;s time to step on the brakes. Remember what made
you special in the first place. It wasn&rsquo;t the number of startups you funded. 
It was the quality. The innovation. The community. You are letting it slip
away. For what? A quick flip? A few more unicorns? Is that really worth it?</p>

<p>Building a successful project is hard. Building a successful company is even
harder. Really hard. There are no shortcurts. And if there were, they certainly 
wouldn&rsquo;t involve ripping off the hard work of others.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s call this behavior what it is: parasitic. And let&rsquo;s make sure it has no
place in our industry. </p>
