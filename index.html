      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">The PostgreSQL Query Cost Model</div>

      <p>Slow database queries harm your organization in many ways. They can damage the
reputation of otherwise great applications, make background processing painfully
slow, and drastically increase the cost of your infrastructure. As a seasoned
web developer, it is absolutely essential to learn about optimization strategies
for your data layer.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Deadlocks in PostgreSQL</div>

      <p>In concurrent systems where resources are locked, two or more processes can end
up in a state in which each process is waiting for the other one. This state is
called a deadlock. Deadlocks are an important issues that can happen in any
database and can be scary when you encounter them for the first time.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Multi Version Concurrency Control</div>

      <p>The most prominent feature of PostgreSQL is how it handles concurrency. Reads
never block writes, and writes never block reads. To achieve this, PostgreSQL
uses the Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) model, an elegant solution for
a very hard problem. If you want to design highly concurrent applications, you
should really invest the time to understand the bits and bolts of this
mechanism.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Transaction Isolation Levels in PostgreSQL</div>

      <p>Misunderstanding transaction isolation levels can lead to disgusting side
effects in your application. Debugging such issues can be more than painful. The
SQL standard defines four levels of transaction isolation. Each of these
isolation levels defines what happens if two concurrent processes try to read
data updated by other processes.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Selecting for Share and Update in PostgreSQL</div>

      <p>A regular select statement does not give you enough protection if you want to
query data and make a change in the database related to it. Other transactions
can update or delete the data you just queried. PostgreSQL offers additional
select statements that lock on read and provide an extra layer of safety.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Advisory Locks and How to Use Them</div>

      <p>PostgreSQL provides the means for creating locks with application defined
meaning. These locks are called <em>Advisory Locks</em> and are an ideal candidate for
concurrency control where the standard MVCC (multiversion concurrency control)
doesn’t fit the bill. Advisory Locks can be the perfect tool in your arsenal
when you need to control access to a shared resource in a distributed system.</p>

      <div class="font-semibold mb-2 text-xl">Understanding PostgreSQL locks</div>

      <p>Locking is an important topic in any kind of database. Without properly handling
locks, an application might not only be slow, it might also be wrong and behave
in some insane ways. Therefore, learning proper locking techniques is essential
for good performance and correctness of our applications.</p>
