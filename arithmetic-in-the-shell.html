      <p>I remember the first time I tried to use the shell.
It was weird that I had to type in things and not just
click around to get things done. But gradually I got
used to it, and after a while it became my primary way
to interact with my computer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t pass much time till I figured out that the
commands that I am typing in are actually part of a
programming language named Bash. That of course changed
everything! Starting from that moment I could combine
the thing I love ( programming ) with the boring chore
of keeping my system in a sane condition. That moment
a new kind of passion for computers was born in my hearth.</p>

<p>But wait! If Bash is a programming language it must be
able to count and do basic arithmetic. This article is
precisely about that &mdash; calculations in the shell.</p>

<h2>Expr</h2>

<p>This task is actually really simple, but there are as always
in Unix, several ways to do it. The oldest method is to use
<code>expr</code> to evaluate expressions. For example to add 2 and 4
we can write the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr </span>2 + 4
6
</code></pre></div>
<p>This seems really easy, but there is a catch. If you try to
multiply numbers using <code>*</code> Bash will throw you back an error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr </span>2 <span class="k">*</span> 4
<span class="nb">expr</span>: syntax error
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case Bash sees <code>*</code> as wildcard operator so you must
use a backslash before the asterisk sign:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr </span>2 <span class="se">\*</span> 4
8
</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point you will probably try to surround the expression
with quotes, but that will also fail:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr</span> <span class="s2">"2 * 4"</span>
2 <span class="k">*</span> 4

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr</span> <span class="s1">'2 * 4'</span>
2 <span class="k">*</span> 4
</code></pre></div>
<p>Apart from this little annoyance, <code>expr</code> is quite powerful. It can
even do boolean arithmetic:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr </span>2 <span class="se">\&lt;</span> 4
1

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">expr </span>4 <span class="se">\&lt;</span> 2
0
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Arithmetic expansion</h2>

<p>There exists a better alternative for <code>expr</code> but is unfortunately
not available in the original Bourne Shell only in the POSIX
compliant one &mdash; arithmetic expansion.</p>

<p>It can also, like <code>expr</code>, take an arithmetic expression, but
instead of printing out the result, it will substitute itself with the
resulting value.  To print out the result we must use <code>echo</code> or <code>print</code>. For
example to multiply 2 and 4 we can write the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$((</span> <span class="m">4</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="k">))</span>
8
</code></pre></div>
<p>Without an <code>echo</code> this command would fail with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="k">$((</span> <span class="m">4</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="k">))</span>
sh: 1: 8: not found
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see in the above example, Bash tried to execute the result
of the expression as a standard command.</p>

<p>Note: There is an older variant of arithmetic expansion that uses the
following less verbose form <code>$[ 1 + 4 ]</code> but is now deprecated.</p>

<h2>Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm in the Shell</h2>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s do something more challenging and try to implement Euclid&rsquo;s
greatest common divisor algorithm in a shell script.</p>

<p>Note: This part will be a little bit advanced and will require you to
be familiar with other common things in Bash like loops and variables.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a shell script and giving it executable
permissions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">touch </span>gcd.sh
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">chmod</span> +x gcd.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>My goal is to invoke my script with two command line arguments and
expect it to print out the greatest common divisor like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>./gcd.sh 14 4
2
</code></pre></div>
<p>To achieve this we will first need to capture the two incoming numbers
with <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$1</span>
<span class="nv">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The remainder of the script is the basic implementation of the Euclid&rsquo;s
algorithm that I presume every programmer recognizes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$1</span>
<span class="nv">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$2</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="nv">$b</span> <span class="nt">-ne</span> 0 <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do
  </span><span class="nv">remainder</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$((</span> <span class="nv">$a</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nv">$b</span> <span class="k">))</span>
  <span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$b</span>
  <span class="nv">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$remainder</span>
<span class="k">done

</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$a</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note: Shame on you if you don&rsquo;t recognize the following algorithm,
go and Google it. This is probably the most basic algorithm out there.
Also, sorry for the harsh words :3</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this article and also that I have shown you
something new and exciting.</p>

<p>Stay awesome!</p>

<p>By the way, I started using drawing tablet instead of the old
paper + photo + gimp approach. I hope you like this new art style.</p>
