      <p>Hi there! My name is Igor Šarčević. I have held the position of Chief Architect
at SemaphoreCI for almost a decade, where I was focusing on increasing developer
productivity and helping close to 50,000 organizations achieve operational
excellence.</p>

<p>In 2023, I decided to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams and founded a startup
focusing on operational excellence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/igor-sarcevic.jpg" alt="Igor Sarcevic" style="border-radius: 40px;"></p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in software design and development,
and have always been passionate about creating innovative solutions that can
improve people&rsquo;s lives. My extensive experience in the field, combined with my
love for entrepreneurship and problem-solving, has led me to my current venture,
where I am working tirelessly to bring my ideas to life.</p>

<p>Through this blog, I hope to share my journey as a software architect turned
entrepreneur, and offer insights and advice to others who are interested in
pursuing a similar path. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned professional or just starting
out, I hope that you&rsquo;ll find my experiences and perspectives to be valuable
and informative.</p>
