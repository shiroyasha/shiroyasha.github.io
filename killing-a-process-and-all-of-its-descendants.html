      <p>Killing processes in a Unix-like system can be trickier than expected. Last
week I was debugging an odd issue related to job stopping on Semaphore.
More specifically, an issue related to the killing of a running process in a
job. </p>

<p>Here are the highlights of what I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unix-like operating systems have sophisticated process relationships.</li>
<li>Sending signals to all processes in a session is not trivial with syscalls.</li>
<li>Processes started with exec inherit their parent signal configuration.</li>
<li>There are many challenges with handling orphaned process groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple types of relationships between processes. Parent-child,
process groups, sessions, and session leaders. However, the details are not
uniform across operating systems like Linux and macOS. POSIX compliant
operating systems support sending signals to process groups with a negative
PID number.</p>

<h2>Killing a parent doesn&rsquo;t kill the child processes</h2>

<p>Every process has a parent. We can observe this with <code>pstree</code> or the <code>ps</code> utility.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c"># start two dummy processes</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sleep </span>100 &amp;
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sleep </span>101 &amp;

<span class="nv">$ </span>pstree <span class="nt">-p</span>

        |-bash<span class="o">(</span>29051<span class="o">)</span>-+-pstree<span class="o">(</span>29251<span class="o">)</span>
                      |-sleep<span class="o">(</span>28919<span class="o">)</span>
                      <span class="sb">`</span><span class="nt">-sleep</span><span class="o">(</span>28964<span class="o">)</span>

29051  1470  1470 29051 pts/2     2386 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">sleep </span>100
29051  1538  1538 29051 pts/2     2386 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">sleep </span>101
29051  2386  2386 29051 pts/2     2386 R+    1000   0:00 ps j <span class="nt">-A</span>
    1 29051 29051 29051 pts/2     2386 Ss    1000   0:00 <span class="nt">-bash</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>ps</code> command displays the PID (id of the process), and the PPID (parent ID
of the process).</p>

<p>I held a very incorrect assumption about this relationship. I thought that if I
kill the parent of a process, it kills the children of that process too.
However, this is incorrect. Instead, child processes become orphaned, and the
init process re-parents them.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see the re-parenting in action by killing the bash process — the current
parent of the sleep commands — and observe the changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">kill </span>29051 <span class="c"># killing the bash process</span>

<span class="nv">$ </span>pstree <span class="nt">-A</span>
init<span class="o">(</span>1<span class="o">)</span>-+
        |-sleep<span class="o">(</span>28919<span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="sb">`</span><span class="nt">-sleep</span><span class="o">(</span>28965<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The re-parenting behavior was odd to me. For example, when I SSH into a server,
start a process, and exit, the started process is killed. I wrongly assumed this
is the default behavior on Linux. It turns that killing of processes when I
leave an SSH session is related to process groups, session leaders, and
controlling terminals.</p>

<h2>What are process groups and session leaders?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s observe the output of <code>ps j</code> from the previous example again.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ps j <span class="nt">-A</span>
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TTY      TPGID STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
    0     1     1     1 ?           <span class="nt">-1</span> Ss       0   0:03 /sbin/init
29051  1470  1470 29051 pts/2     2386 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">sleep </span>100
29051  1538  1538 29051 pts/2     2386 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">sleep </span>101
29051  2386  2386 29051 pts/2     2386 R+    1000   0:00 ps j <span class="nt">-A</span>
    1 29051 29051 29051 pts/2     2386 Ss    1000   0:00 <span class="nt">-bash</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Apart from the parent-child relationship expressed by PPID and PID, we have two
other relationships:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process groups represented by PGID</li>
<li>Sessions represented by SID</li>
</ul>

<p>Process groups are observable in shells that support job control, like <code>bash</code>
and <code>zsh</code>, that are creating a process group for every pipeline of commands. A
process group is a collection of one or more processes (usually associated with
the same job) that can receive signals from the same terminal. Each process
group has a unique process group ID.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c"># start a process group that consists of tail and grep</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> /var/log/syslog | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s2">"CRON"</span> &amp;

<span class="nv">$ </span>ps j
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TTY      TPGID STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
29051 19701 19701 29051 pts/2    19784 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">tail</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> /var/log/syslog
29051 19702 19701 29051 pts/2    19784 SN    1000   0:00 <span class="nb">grep </span>CRON
29051 19784 19784 29051 pts/2    19784 R+    1000   0:00 ps j
29050 29051 29051 29051 pts/2    19784 Ss    1000   0:00 <span class="nt">-bash</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the PGID of <code>tail</code> and <code>grep</code> is the same in the previous snippet.</p>

<p>A session is a collection of process groups, usually associated with one
controlling terminals and a session leader process. If a session has a
controlling terminal, it has a single foreground process group, and all other
process groups in the session are background process groups.</p>

<p><img src="/images/killing-a-process-and-all-of-its-descendants/sessions.png" alt="sessions" /></p>

<p>Not all bash processes are sessions, but when you SSH into a remote server, you
usually get a session. When bash runs as a session leader, it propagates the
SIGHUP signal to its children. SIGHUP propagation to children was the core
reason for my long-held belief that children are dying along with the parents.</p>

<h2>Sessions are not consistent across Unix implementations</h2>

<p>In the previous examples, you can notice the occurrence of SID, the session ID
of the process. It is the ID shared by all processes in a session.</p>

<p>However, you need to keep in mind that this is not true across all Unix
implementations. The Single UNIX Specification talks only about a &ldquo;session
leader&rdquo;; there is no &ldquo;session ID&rdquo; similar to a process ID or a process group ID.
A session leader is a single process that has a unique process ID, so we could
talk about a session ID that is the process ID of the session leader.</p>

<p>System V Release 4 introduced Session IDs.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that you get session ID in the <code>ps</code> output on Linux, but
on BSD and its variants like MacOS, the session ID isn&rsquo;t present or always zero.</p>

<h2>Killing all processes in a process group or session</h2>

<p>We can use that PGID to send a signal to the whole group with the kill utility:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">kill</span> <span class="nt">-SIGTERM</span> <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="nt">-19701</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We used a negative number <code>-19701</code> to send a signal to the group. If kill
receives a positive number, it kills the process with that ID. If we pass a
negative number, it kills the process group with that PGID.</p>

<p>The negative number comes from the system call definition directly.</p>

<p>Killing all processes in a session is quite different. As explained in the
previous section, some systems don&rsquo;t have a notion of a session ID. Even the
ones that have session IDs, like Linux, don&rsquo;t have a system call to kill all
processes in a session. You need to walk the <code>/proc</code> tree, collect the SIDs, and
terminate the processes.</p>

<p>Pgrep implements the algorithm for walking, collecting, and process killing by
session ID.  Use the following snipped:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>pkill <span class="nt">-s</span> &lt;SID&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Nohup propagation to process descendants</p>

<p>Ignored signals, like the ones ignored with <code>nohup</code>, are propagated to all
descendants of a process. This propagation was the final bottleneck in my bug
hunting exercise last week.</p>

<p>In my program — an agent for running bash commands — I verified that I have an
established a bash session that has a controlling terminal. It is the session
leader of the processes started in that bash session. My process tree looks like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>agent -+
       +- bash <span class="o">(</span>session leader<span class="o">)</span> -+
                                 | - process1
                                 | - process2
</code></pre></div>
<p>I assumed that when I kill the bash session with SIGHUP, it kills the children
as well. Integration tests on the agent also verified this.</p>

<p>However, what I missed was that the agent is started with <code>nohup</code>. When you
start a subprocess with <code>exec</code>, like we start the bash process in the agent, it
inherits the signals states from its parents.</p>

<p>This last one took me by surprise.</p>
