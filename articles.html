        <p>The most prominent feature of PostgreSQL is how it handles concurrency. Reads
never block writes, and writes never block reads. To achieve this, PostgreSQL
uses the Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) model, an elegant solution for
a very hard problem. If you want to design highly concurrent applications, you
should really invest the time to understand the bits and bolts of this
mechanism.</p>

        <p>Misunderstanding transaction isolation levels can lead to disgusting side
effects in your application. Debugging such issues can be more than painful. The
SQL standard defines four levels of transaction isolation. Each of these
isolation levels defines what happens if two concurrent processes try to read
data updated by other processes.</p>

        <p>A regular select statement does not give you enough protection if you want to

        <p>PostgreSQL provides the means for creating locks with application defined
meaning. These locks are called <em>Advisory Locks</em> and are an ideal candidate for
concurrency control where the standard MVCC (multiversion concurrency control)
doesn’t fit the bill. Advisory Locks can be the perfect tool in your arsenal
when you need to control access to a shared resource in a distributed system.</p>

        <p>A lot of developers choose to avoid the often big, clumsy and complicated
IDEs in favor of the Linux command line. At first sight the command line
is inferior to the experience you get from a full blown IDE. However, the
beauty of the command line is just that. It is fast, simple, and by default
it comes with very small set of pre-installed features.</p>
