      <p>The majority of today&rsquo;s development is oriented around the web or around desktop/mobile applications. For the average programmer it could even seem like there is no other programming area out there. However, there is actually a huge number of programs developed for cars, televisions, phones, and similar everyday technologies. This article is focused on a small fraction of those areas &mdash; sms messages.</p>

<h2>The code executor</h2>

<p>Two or three months ago I watched <a href="http://shiroyasha.github.io/sinatra-app-with-rspec.html">an episode on Computerphile</a>, where a young programmer demonstrated his applications that receives code through sms messages, runs that code, and answers him back on his phone. I was fascinated with his applications, and today I will try to demonstrate the basics of this process, using a service that connects sms messages to web applications &mdash; <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. In a nutshell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Create a web application that receives ruby code from sms messages,
executes that code, and sends back an sms with the output.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Bootstrap</h2>

<p>To achieve the above we will use the Sinatra web framework, and Twilio&rsquo;s
gem to receive SMS messages. Our Gemfile should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s2">"https://rubygems.org"</span>

<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"rack"</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"sinatra"</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"activesupport"</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"twilio-ruby"</span>

<span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:test</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"rspec"</span>
  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"rack-test"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Also, we will set up a Sinatra route that will receive Twilio&rsquo;s webhooks
in our main application file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">post</span> <span class="s2">"/sms-code"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="s2">"Hello human!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Responding to sms messages</h2>

<p>To respond to sms messages, we will have to use Twilio&rsquo;s <code>twiml</code> language,
and construct an XML response that Twilio can understand. To answer
<code>Hello human!</code> to every incoming message we can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">post</span> <span class="s2">"/sms-code"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">twiml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Twilio</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TwiML</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Message</span> <span class="s2">"Hello human!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="n">twiml</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">text</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run our application and visit <code>/sms-code</code> we should see an output like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight xml"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;Response&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;Message&gt;</span>Hello Human!<span class="nt">&lt;/Message&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/Response&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Connecting this service to Twilio</h2>

<p>At this point we should create a Twilio account with a phone number that will
receive the messages and a place to host our application online. For example a
<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> dyno would be an excellent choice.</p>

<p>After that we need to set up a webhook for our number on Twilio, where
all the incoming messages will arrive. We should visit our number&rsquo;s settings
and add the full URL to our sms handler. We will use the <code>POST</code> HTTP
method so that Twilio won&rsquo;t cache our requests and responses.
The setting screen should look similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/twilio_number_setup.png" alt="Webhook settings on Twilio" /></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want Twilio to cache your responses, use the <code>GET</code> method.
In our use case we don&rsquo;t want that caching to happen so we use <code>POST</code>.</p>

<h2>Receiving the message</h2>

<p>The previous example responded <code>Hello human!</code> to every received sms message.
We will now extend our application and use the body of the incoming sms
message.</p>

<p>The following example takes the incoming message with <code>params[:Body]</code>
and evaluates it as executable Ruby code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is very dangerous,</span>
<span class="c1"># Don't do it without adult supervision!</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">160</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">post</span> <span class="s2">"/sms-code"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">twiml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Twilio</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TwiML</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Message</span> <span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:Body</span><span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="n">twiml</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">text</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>After deployment this code you should evaluate and return the results of
incoming sms messages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above code segment uses the body parameter of the sms message
to evaluate some Ruby code. This is very dangerous, and is only used for
demonstration purposes.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Working with sms is really fun especially the part where your phone vibrates
and shows the result of your code. This exercise can also serve as a great
warm up before creating two factor authorization or similar sms bound systems.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/shiroyasha/sms-ruby-code">example repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
