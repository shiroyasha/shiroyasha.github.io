    <div class="content">
      <p>Last week I was debugging a weird bug in one of our services. In the logs we
saw an SQL error &ldquo;repetition-operator operand invalid&rdquo;, so I was pretty sure
that we have a broken SQL comparison in one of our services. The weird part
was that this error happened only occasionally, seemingly randomly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After several hours of debugging, we learned something mind boggling at that
moment &mdash; boolean expressions in <code>where</code> statements are not short
circuited. This definitely clashed with our assumptions, and teched us an
important lesson to always double check our assumptions when designing a
system.</p>

<h2>The system that we debugged</h2>

<p>In one of our services, we had a scheme where we construct <em>rules</em>, where each
rule is activated if it matches one or more regular expression patterns. For
example, the following rule would be &ldquo;activated&rdquo; by <code>master</code>, <code>staging-alpha</code>,
or <code>release-3</code>, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be activated by <code>feature/new-icons</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">rule</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">non-feature-branches"</span>
  <span class="na">patterns</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">/^master$/</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">/^staging-.*$/</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">/^release-3$/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We were using this system to activate some features based on git branch names,
as you could already guess by the previous examples. A repository has multiple
rules in this context.</p>

<p>We encoded this information in the following SQL tables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">table</span> <span class="n">repository</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">id</span>   <span class="nb">integer</span>
  <span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">string</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">table</span> <span class="n">rules</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">id</span>      <span class="nb">integer</span>
  <span class="n">repo_id</span> <span class="nb">integer</span>
  <span class="n">name</span>    <span class="n">string</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">table</span> <span class="n">patterns</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">rule_id</span> <span class="nb">integer</span>
  <span class="n">term</span>    <span class="n">string</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The following query would list rules that are activated by a branch name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">rules</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">rules</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">repo_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">patterns</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">rule</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">patterns</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">rule_id</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">~</span> <span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">term</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The bug</h2>

<p>As stated in the intro, the SQL error was <code>invalid regular expression: quantifier operand invalid</code>
which happens if you have an invalid regular expression in a SQL select
statement. In our case, the poisonous regular expression was <code>*</code>, which is
invalid, and should be <code>.*</code>.</p>

<p>The weird part was that the pattern was not part of the repository we were
filtering, and we were totally baffled why it is raised, if it should never
even be tested.</p>

<p>Here is our assumptions how the following query should have worked:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">rules</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">rules</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">repo_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">patterns</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">rule</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">patterns</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">rule_id</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">~</span> <span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">term</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li>First, we filter only repositories that we are interested in with <code>rules.repo_id = ($1)</code></li>
<li>Then, we find the patterns associated with that subset with <code>rule.id = patterns.rule_id</code> in the inner query</li>
<li>Finally, we filter that subset with the innermost regex match <code>($2) ~ pattern.term</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the previous assumption, and order of operations, even if we had a
broken rule in our system, it would only affect repositories that are using that
rule, but no others.</p>

<p>This was false. The order of operations is different in SQL, as there is no
short-circuiting between <code>AND</code> statements in an SQL query.</p>

<h2>How to prove that short-circuiting is not working?</h2>

<p>We hypothesised that short-circuiting is not working, but we needed a proof.
SQL <code>explain</code> and <code>explain analyse</code> helped us to prove our hypothesis.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight sql"><code><span class="k">EXPLAIN</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">rules</span>

<p>Turns out the actual order of operations is:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, the whole rules table is filtered based on <code>repo_id = 1</code>.</li>
<li>Then, then we find the first pattern that matches <code>&#39;master&#39;::text ~ (term)::text</code></li>
<li>Finally, the join filter <code>rules.id = patterns.rule_id</code> is applied to combine the results</li>
</ol>

<p>This was obviously in direct contradiction to our basic assumption that SQL
follows <code>AND</code> joins in order they appear, and short circuit if the first
expression is false.</p>
