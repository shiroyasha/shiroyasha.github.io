      <p>Being more productive was always a topic that interested me.
Small life hacks here and there can definitely add up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As a strong believer in the scientific method, I like to tests out
various new ideas regularly, measure their impact on my productivity,
and to reflect on the results to make the process even smoother in
future.</p>

<p><img src="/images/specific-time-specific-place.png" alt="Specific time &amp; specific place" /></p>

<p>What follows are my attempts to do more, with less effort. Especially
when it comes to accomplishing one-off tasks that will benefit me
in the long run. For example, getting an eye exam, purchasing a bicycle,
or renewing my passport.</p>

<h3>Why do I struggle with achieving my goals?</h3>

<p>We can divide my goals into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>low priority, with significant benefits in the long run</li>
<li>high priority, that have to be dealt with immediately, like paying rent</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no issues with high priority tasks. They have a burning deadline
that I need to resolve immediately.</p>

<p>However, low priority goals with long term benefits are an issue. Tasks
that would improve my quality of life, but have no deadlines. These
are the tasks that you always want to do, but you never have
time to do them.</p>

<p>First, I say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do them tomorrow&rdquo; and then I continue with
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do them next week&rdquo; and finally I put them in a basket
of no return, the dreaded &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do them when I have time or motivation&rdquo;.
Turns out that I never have the motivation to do them.</p>

<h3>Strategy #1: Setting up OKRs</h3>

<p>Borrowing good practices from the software industry, I started this year
by setting up a list of Objectives for the first three months of the year.</p>

<p>Previously, I was simply &ldquo;trying my best&rdquo; to improve my life with no clear
direction or plan. This worked to some degree. Waiting for the magic to
hit me, the moment when I would do some amazing things. This in practice
happened rarely, and even when the it hit me, I was not entirely sure
what I want to do.</p>

<p>OKRs are a huge improvement. Now I have a clear vision what I want to achieve
and a tool for measuring my progress.</p>

<p>However, this strategy failed in one crucial aspect. Three months are a big
time window. In the first three quarters of this year, my productivity only
spiked at two occasions: the week when I wrote down the OKRs at the beginning
of the quarter when my motivation was high, and the last week when I had to
score my progress when I panicked and finished all possible tasks that are
achievable in one week.</p>

<p>I wanted to achieve a more consistent output from myself. I wanted to do at
least one important task per week.</p>

<h3>Strategy #2: Weekly plans</h3>

<p>To further improve my output, every Sunday I&rsquo;ve reviewed my OKRs and
constructed a list of tasks for the upcoming week that would bring me
closer to my goals.</p>

<p>This reduced my response time, as I&rsquo;ve reviewed my goals at least once per
week, however the underlying issue didn&rsquo;t go away. I was still leaving the
important task for the last day of the week, and unfortunately many of the
plans were not achievable during the weekend.</p>

<h3>Strategy #3: Selecting a specific date and time</h3>

<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve recognized the core issue. I was setting up deadlines, but
I didn&rsquo;t have a specific time when I would execute the task. This way, it
was far too easy to move the task for the next day or next week because I
wasn&rsquo;t committed to the action.</p>

<p>To fix the issue, now when I&rsquo;m planning my week I set up a specific date
and time, and log it into google calendars. For example, now if I want to
go to the dentist, I don&rsquo;t say I will do it next week. Instead, I write down:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the dentist next Wednesday at 18:00h&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This precise formulation gives me urgency. I even get a notification on
my phone if I forget about the task. A huge productivity win.</p>

<h2>Combining all the strategies for the best result</h2>

<p>Currently, my best approach is to combine all three strategies.</p>

<p>First, I set up high level goals for myself in form of OKRs. I do this
every three months. Then, every weekend, I review my OKRs and based on them
construct a list of tasks that I want to achieve that week. Finally, I
take the list of tasks, find a precise time slot for them, and set
up the alarms.</p>
